# Lending Club Case Study
> Lending money is always risky. In this project I have tried to find patterns for defaulters. This analysis will help agencies to validate users before recommending for loan.


## Table of Contents
* Lending Club Case Study
* Python3, pandas, matplotlib, numpy & Excel 
* Maximum defaulters are people who took loan for 36 months tenure for debt_clearance as reason


## General Information
- The Data set (loan.csv) consist of 111 columns and 39717 rows
- From the given data set patterns are identified for defaulters
- I am trying to help Loan approval agencies to validate applicants and reduce credit risk for lending companies


## Conclusions
- I can conclude, if a applicant is from [CA, CO, SC, KY] regions with annual income in [22500 ~ 36000] bracket, applying for amount [4100 ~ 5500] for duration of 36 months staying in rented appartment should be DENIED loan to reduce risk of credit loss.

## Technologies Used
- pandas==1.3.4
- matplotlib
- numpy
